      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hey hey, so you want to learn more about me? Cool! You've come to the right place. As you probably guessed by
        now my name is Tyler (or Rad), and I am from Europa (the continent, not the moon! üòÑ). It is a bit vague, I
        know, but what is life without a little mystery in it?</p>
      <p>
        Truthfully there isn't much to say, I have had an interest in tech and computers since I was a kid. I have been
        using computers since I was 4 years old, but I mostly kept to the hardware side of things, such as building PCs,
        maintaining them, fixing issues both hardware and software. I didn't really delve into programming and software
        development until much later in life... Well, couple of years now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from the above, I have many hobbies and interests, which I will break down neatly in a list below, along
        with some fun (in my opinion) facts about me.</p>

      <p>I studied and graduated High School in the Middle East, and afterwards I moved to the UK where for a number of
        years I worked various jobs in customer service and whatnot, then I went to Suffolk New College where I got my
        Access to Higher Education diploma and then I applied to study Computer Science at university. I got in at
        King's College London but unfortunately after only half a semester I had to drop out due to multiple surgeries
        and health issues. Now here I am!</p>

    <section class="fun-facts">
      <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
      <p>Honestly... Coming up with a list of fun facts about me is harder than I thought it would be, nevertheless,
        here they are!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I speak three languages fluently.</li>
        <li>I self-taught English from when I was a kid.</li>
        <li>I am a touch typist and my record was 135 WPM (words per minute).</li>
        <li>I've lived in four different countries and stepped foot in 9.</li>
        <li>I closed a van door on my pinky finger and it never broke, just swole.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Hobbies & interests</h3>
      <p>These are some of my hobbies and interests, the list is not exhausted and this is just a small bit of the
        things I enjoy.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rock & Metal - I love whatever sounds pleasing to my ears, however Rock & Metal are my favorite genres, some
          of my favorite bands include Lamb of God, Gojira, Sabaton and more.</li>
        <li>Space - The idea of space and space exploration is so cool, I don't know if I will ever be able to explore
          the frontiers of space, likely not.</li>
        <li>Motorcycles & Cars - I LOVE them, especially motorcycles. One of my goals is to acquire a motorcycle some
          day and hopefully be able to ride it for as long as the roads are.</li>
        <li>Aviation - The world of aviation is such a wonderful thing, I have flown many times (as a passenger) and
          every single time it was such a joy. Amazing what humanity achieved.</li>
        <li>Graphics Design - I do enjoy graphics design and I have self-taught how to do things in Adobe Photoshop for
          many years now, however not at a professional level.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>My Flock</h2>
    <p>These are my birds, I love them very much and they're family! Each one of them has their own unique personality
      and full of life, some are more reserved and don't like to interact with me, while others can't get enough of head
      scratches and whatnot! Come meet the family!</p>
